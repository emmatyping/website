Title: About

Hi! My name is Emma and I am a passionate open source developer living in the San Francisco Bay Area. I have a very wide range of interests from programming languages/compilers, to compression formats, to quantum computing, and more!

I started learning to program when I was in high school, when I taught myself Python 2 ðŸ˜±. Since then, I've been learning more about programming languages, both their designs and implementations.

In my open source work, I am a core developer on the mypy project, and a triager for CPython.

I currently work on Python packaging at NVIDIA. In my free time I like to work on the above mentioned open source projects, play Minecraft, and play with my cat.
