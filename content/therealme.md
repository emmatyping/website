I'm really excited for the opportunity to introduce my true self. A while back
I began exploring my gender expression, and today marks an important step in my
journey. So let me re-introduce myself, the real me this time.

Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Emma, a trans woman. I use she/her pronouns.

I'm the same person, just more... me! So all the stuff in
[About Me](/pages/about.html) is still true! Expect more posts about Python,
packaging, and whatever other hobby projects I have going on.

Finally, I'd like to thank my wife and everyone who has supported me on this
journey so far. I feel so lucky to be surrounded by so many supportive friends
and family members. I absolutely could not have gotten this far without them.
